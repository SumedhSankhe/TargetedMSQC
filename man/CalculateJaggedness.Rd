\title{This file contains the functions that calculate the QC metrics for peaks and
peak groups.
Compute the jaggedness score for a transition peak.}
\usage{
CalculateJaggedness(sig, flatness.factor = 0.05, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{sig}{A numeric vector representing a transition peak}

\item{flatness.factor}{A numeric parameter between 0 and 1 that determines
the sensitivity of the jaggedness score to low levels of noise. To avoid high
jaggedness scores due to small levels of noise, near-flat ranges in the peak
are artificially flattened before calculating the jaggedness score. A range
is defined as near-flat and thus flattened when the difference between
intensities of adjacent time points is smaller than flatness.factor times the
peak maximum intensity.}
}
\value{
The numeric value of jaggedness score for the transition peak, which
is defined as the fraction of timepoints where the signal changes direction
}
\description{
The function takes a numeric vector representing a transition peak as input
and calculates the jaggedness score for the peak. The jaggedness score is
defined as the fraction of timepoints where the signal changes direction,
excluding the change of direction at the peak apex. This function can be
called independently, however it is mainly meant to be called by
CalculatePeakJaggedness to calculate the jaggedness metric for a peak group.
For high quality peaks, the jaggedness score is expected to be close to 0.
}
\examples{

peak <- data.CSF$data$PeakGroup[[196]]
transition.jaggedness.y6 <- CalculateJaggedness(peak@sig$y6.1.heavy, flatness.factor = 0.05)
PlotChromPeak(peak,transition.list = c("y6"))
