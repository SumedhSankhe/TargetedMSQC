\title{Compute symmetry scores for transition peaks in a peak group object.}
\usage{
CalculatePeakSymmetry(peak, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak}{A peak group object}
}
\value{
A list with the following objects:
              r.symmetry: A numeric vector of symmetry scores for each
              transition in the peak group.
              peak.symmetry: Mean of the r.symmetry vector. This score
              represents the overall symmetry of all the transitions in the
              peak group.
}
\description{
The function takes a peak group object as input and calculates the
symmetry score for the transition peaks in the peak group. The symmetry score
is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the left and right
halves of the peak intensity vector divided at the timepoint in the middle.
For high quality peaks, the symmetry score is expected to be close to 1.

peak <- data.CSF$data$PeakGroup[[1]]
