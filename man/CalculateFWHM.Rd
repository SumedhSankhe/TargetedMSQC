\title{Compute FWHM and ratio of FWHM to peak width at base for transition peaks in
a peak group object.}
\usage{
CalculateFWHM(peak, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak}{A peak group object}
}
\value{
A list with the following objects:
              r.fwhm: A numeric vector of FWHM for each transition in the peak
              group.
              peak.fwhm: Mean of the r.fwhm vector.
              r.fwhm2base: A numeric vector of FWHM to peak width at base
              ratio for each transition in the peak group.
              peak.fwhm2base: Mean of the r.fwhm2base vector.
}
\description{
The function takes a peak group object as input and calculates the
full-width at half-max (FWHM) and the FWHM to peak width at the base ratios
for the transition peaks in the peak group.
