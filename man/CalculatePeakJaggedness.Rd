\title{Compute jaggedness scores for transition peaks in a peak group object.}
\usage{
CalculatePeakJaggedness(peak, flatness.factor = 0.05, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak}{A peak group object}

\item{flatness.factor}{A numeric parameter between 0 and 1 that determines
the sensitivity of the jaggedness score to low levels of noise. To avoid high
jaggedness scores due to small levels of noise, near-flat ranges in the peak
are artificially flattened before calculating the jaggedness score. A range
is defined as near-flat and thus flattened when the difference between
intensities of adjacent time points is smaller than flatness.factor times the
peak maximum intensity.}
}
\value{
A list with the following objects:
              r.jaggedness: A numeric vector of jaggedness scores for each
              transition in the peak group.
}
\description{
The function takes a peak group object as input and calculates the
jaggedness score for the transition peaks in the peak group using the
CalculateJaggedness function. The jaggedness score is defined as the fraction
of timepoints where the signal changes direction, excluding the change of
direction at the peak apex. For high quality peaks, the jaggedness score is
expected to be close to 0.

\examples{

peak <- data.CSF$data$PeakGroup[[196]]
peak.group.jaggedness <- CalculatePeakJaggedness(peak)
