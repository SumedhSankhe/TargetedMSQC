\title{Compute pairwise elution shift of transition peaks in a peak group object.}
\usage{
CalculatePeakElutionShift(peak, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak}{A peak group object}
}
\value{
A list with the following objects:
              r.shift: A numeric matrix where the non-diagonal elements
              represent the pairwise shift between transition peaks and diagonal
              elements represent the shift between each transition peak relative
              to the median time at max of all the transition peaks in the
              peak group.
}
\description{
The function takes a peak group object as input and calculates the pairwise
shift between transition peaks in the peak group using the CalculateElutionShift
function. The shift between two transition peaks is defined as the difference
between time at max for the two peaks normalized by the peak width at base.
The shift between an individual transition peak relative to the peak group is
defined as the different between time at mas of the transition peak and the
median of time at max of all the peaks in the peak group normalized by the
peak width at base. For high quality peaks, the elution shift is expected to
be close to 0.
