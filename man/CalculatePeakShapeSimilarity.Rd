\title{Compute similarity scores for transition peaks in a peak group object.}
\usage{
CalculatePeakShapeSimilarity(peak, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak}{A peak group object}
}
\value{
A list with the following objects:
              r.similarity: A numeric matrix of pairwise similarity scores
              for transition peaks in the peak group.
              peak.jaggedness: Mean of the r.similarity. vector. This score
              represents the overall similarity of all the transitions in the
              peak group.
}
\description{
The function takes a peak group object as input and calculates
pairwise similarity scores for the transition peaks in the peak group.
Similarity score is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between
the signal intensity vectors of the two peaks. For high quality peaks, the
similarity score is expected to be close to 1.

peak <- data.CSF$data$PeakGroup[[1]]
