\title{Compute the sum of transition peaks in a peak group object}
\usage{
CalculateTransitionSum(
  peak,
  endogenous.label = "light",
  standard.label = "heavy"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak}{A peak group object}

\item{endogenous.label}{Label of the endogenous analyte: default is "light"}

\item{standard.label}{Label of the spiked-in isotopically labeled analyte:
default is "heavy"}
}
\value{
A peak group object, which contains two peaks: sum of light transition
peaks and sum of heavy transition peaks in the input peak group
}
\description{
The function takes a peak group object as input and calculates the sum of the
peak intensities of transition peaks with identical labels. For example, all
the endogenous transition peaks with labels of "light" will be added up to
create the "sum.0.light" peak and all the spiked-in standard transition peaks
with labels of "heavy" will be added up to create the "sum.0.heavy" peak.
}
\examples{

peak <- data.CSF$data$PeakGroup[[1]]
peak.sum <- CalculateTransitionSum(peak)
PlotChromPeak(peak.sum)
