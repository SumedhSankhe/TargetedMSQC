\title{This file contains the functions that clean up the input data and calculate
the features associated with peaks and peak groups.
Convert the exported skyline chromatogram and peak boundary reports to a
dataframe format compatible with TargetedMSQC functions.}
\usage{
CleanUpChromatograms(
  chromatogram.path = NULL,
  peak.boundary.path = NULL,
  labkey.url.base = NULL,
  labkey.url.path = NULL,
  labkey = FALSE,
  endogenous.label = "light",
  standard.label = "heavy",
  iRT.list = iRTList(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{chromatogram.path}{Path to the directory containing the .tsv files of
the peak chromatograms. For each Skyline document, this file is exported from
Skyline through File > Export > Chromatograms. Here, check runs of interest
and include Precursors, Products, Base Peaks and TICs. Each chromatogram .tsv
file corresponds to a single Skyline document, which may contain any number
of runs. Multiple chromatogram files, corresponding to multiple Skyline documents
can be copied into the chromatogram.path directory. For each chromatogram file
in this folder, there should be a peak boundary file with an identical name
in peak.boundary.path directory.}

\item{peak.boundary.path}{Path to the directory containing the .csv files of
the peak boundaries. For each Skyline document, this file is exported from
Skyline through File > Export > Report. Here, select Peak Boundaries. Each
peak boundary .csv file corresponds to a single Skyline document, which may
contain any number of runs. Multiple peak boundary files, corresponding to
multiple Skyline documents can be copied into the peak.boundary.path directory.
For each peak boundary file in this folder, there should be a peak chromatogram
file with an identical name in chromatogram.path directory.}

\item{labkey.url.base}{URL of the labkey server, if data is being imported
from labkey (labkey = TRUE). This feature has not been implemented yet.}

\item{labkey.url.path}{Path to the directory containing the Skyline documents
on the labkey server, if data is being imported from labkey (labkey = TRUE).
This feature has not been implemented yet.}

\item{labkey}{Logical parameter to indicate whether data will be imported from
labkey. This feature has not been implemented yet. Set labkey = FALSE.}

\item{endogenous.label}{Label of the endogenous analyte: default is "light"}

\item{standard.label}{Label of the spiked-in isotopically labeled analyte: default is "heavy"}

\item{iRT.list}{List of iRT standards used in the experiment. These peptides
will be removed from the training set.}
}
\value{
A list with the following objects:
              data: A dataframe that contains all rows of the input data with
              assigned peak boundaries. This dataframe also includes columns
              for peakObj objects created for each peak group.
              removed: A dataframe that contains the rows with missing peak
              boundary values, too few transitions and missing isotope pairs.
              These rows are removed from downstream feature extraction and
              QC analysis.
}
\description{
The function takes the directories that contain chromatogram and peak boundary
files of Skyline documents and merges them. The rows with NA values for peak
boundaries, rows corresponding to peptides with fewer than 3 transitions and
transitions missing a standard isotope pair are separated into a dataframe
that is returned by the function in output$removed and excluded from subsequence
QC steps. The remainder of the rows are returned by the function in output$data
for subsequence analysis. Transition peaks of each peptide in each run are
formed into peak groups of custom class peakObj and stored in the ChromGroup
column. The ApplyPeakBoundary function is applied to chromatograms to restrict
them to the provided peak boundaries and the results are stored in the PeakGroup
column. Additionally, rows are added for the "sum" transition, which are is
the sum of peptides transitions with the same isotope label in each sample.
