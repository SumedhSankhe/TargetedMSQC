\title{Create the dataset used as input to the TrainQCModel function.}
\usage{
MakeDataSet(
  feature.path = NULL,
  training.path = NULL,
  feature.data = NULL,
  training.data = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature.path}{Alternative to providing the feature.data, a path to the
directory that contains the features.csv file exported by ExtractFeatures
function can be provided. This file can be generated by by setting
export.features = TRUE and specifying the feature.path in ExtractFeatures
function. If both feature.data and feature.path are provided, feature.path is
ignored.}

\item{training.path}{Path to the directory containing the annotated template
file. The template file is generated using the MakeTemplate function should be
manually annotated by an expert analyst and saved as a separate .csv file. The
path to this annotated file should be provided. Please note that the directory
should contain only annotated .csv files that are meant to be in the study.}

\item{feature.data}{A dataframe that contains peak identifiers (File,FileName,
PeptideModifiedSequence,FragmentIon,IsotopeLabelType,PrecursorCharge and ProductCharge)
as well as  QC metrics calcualted for each transition pair. This dataframe is
the output of ExtractFeatures function (output$features).}

\item{training.data}{Alternative to providing a path, the training data can
be provided explicitly.}
}
\value{
A list with the following objects:
              data.merged: A dataframe that is product of merging and cleaning
              up feature.data and training.data.
              feature.data: The input feature.data
              training.data: The annotated input training.data
              data.training.feature: A dataframe that is product of merging
              and cleaning up feature.data and training.data. This dataframe
              contain only peaks that have been manually annotated and are
              included in training.data This data can be used by the
              TrainQCModel for training a predictive peak QC model.
}
\description{
The function takes the feature dataframe (containing the calculated ensemble
of QC features) and the annotated training dataframe and merges them to create
the input of the TrainQCModel function.
