\title{Compute elution shift of a transition peak relative to a reference peak.}
\usage{
CalculateElutionShift(sig1, sig2, time, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{sig1}{A numeric vector representing a transition peak whose relative
elution shift to the reference peak is to be calculated.}

\item{sig2}{A numeric vector representing the reference peak.}

\item{time}{A numeric vector representing the timepoints series of the peaks}
}
\value{
Numeric value of the relative shift (no unit) between sig1 and sig2.
}
\description{
The function takes two numeric vectors representing transition peaks as input
and calculates their relative shift. Additionally, it needs to timepoints
corresponding to the input transition peaks. The shift between these
transition peaks is defined as the difference between time at max for the two
peaks normalized by the peak width at base. This function should only be used
for peaks that belong to the same peak group and have the same peak boundary
and timepoints. Although this function can be used independently, it is meant
to be called by CalculatePeakElutionShift. For high quality peaks, the elution
shift is expected to be close to 0.

\examples{

peak <- data.CSF$data$PeakGroup[[1]]
transition.shift.y6 <- CalculateElutionShift(sig1 = peak@sig$y6.1.light, sig2 = peak@sig$y6.1.heavy,time = peak@time)
}
