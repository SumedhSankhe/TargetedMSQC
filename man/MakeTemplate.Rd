\arguments{
\item{chromatogram.path}{Path to the directory containing the .tsv files of
the peak chromatograms. For each Skyline document, this file is exported from
Skyline through File > Export > Chromatograms. Here, check runs of interest
and include Precursors, Products, Base Peaks and TICs. Each chromatogram .tsv
file corresponds to a single Skyline document, which may contain any number
of runs. Multiple chromatogram files, corresponding to multiple Skyline
documents can be copied into the chromatogram.path directory. For each
chromatogram file in this folder, there should be a peak boundary file with
an identical name in peak.boundary.path directory.}

\item{template.path}{Path to the directory, where the template file will be
saved.}

\item{training.filename.list}{List of the runs that are going to be used for
training. if set to defaul of "all", all the runs in the chromatogram file
will be used for training.}

\item{endogenous.label}{Label of the endogenous analyte: default is "light"}

\item{standard.label}{Label of the spiked-in isotopically labeled analyte:
default is "heavy"}

\item{iRT.list}{List of iRT standards used in the experiment. These peptides
will be removed from the training set.}

\value{
Saves the template .csv file in template.path
}
\description{
The function takes the directory that contains chromatogram of Skyline
documents and creates a template for manual annotation of the peaks. The
template is saved as a .csv file in the directory specified by template.path.
This templae should be shared with an analyst for manual annotation and the
"Status" column should be filled with "flag" or "ok" for low and high quality
peaks, respectively. Any comments about the manual annotation can be entered
in the "Notes" column.
